---------- Sound Studio VR ----------

Intended Experience:
The intende experience for the user is to simply enjoy this fun little experience. It's not meant to be deep or adventerous, but simply a fun little distraction to toy around in.

Users are able to play these virtual instruments using the sticks provided. Simply strike a playable part of an instrument and see what kind of small tunes you can make!

Controls:
There are no button controls. Simply move the sticks around with your hands and strike the playable parts of the instruments to hear a tone play.

-------- NOTE --------
Originally there was going to be a Particle effect when striking the instruments but it has been disabled. It is still wtihin the Project Files in the Prefabs section if you wish to view it.
